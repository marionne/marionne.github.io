summary: LEGv8 Processor on an FPGA
---

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/vacay-home-page.png">

I simulated a non-pipelined LEGv8 Processor based on the instruction set architecture (ISA) ARMv8. Waveform simulations will be uploaded soon.

I also attempted to implement a pipelined LEGv8 Processor on an FPGA. I fully intend on completing this when time permits.
