summary: Memory Game on an FPGA
---

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/vacay-home-page.png">

A project that I continue to volunteer for, I was assigned the task of modifying preexisting Python2 code and updating the syntax to reflect Python3's. I learned how to capture packets from a drone using Kali Linux, as well as how to parse through a JSON file that details packet information and use the NumPy and the Matplotlib librares to arrange and plot packet data.

I implemented a memory game that is heavily based on the game SIMON on the Basys3 FPGA board using the hardware description language (HDL), SystemVerilog.


A demo is available upon request.
