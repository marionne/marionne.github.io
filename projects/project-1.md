summary: Memory Game on an FPGA
---

<img class="ui large right floated rounded image" src="../images/yeah.png">

I implemented a memory game that is heavily based on the game SIMON on the Basys3 FPGA board using the hardware description language (HDL), SystemVerilog.

A demo is available upon request.
