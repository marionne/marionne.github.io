A project that I continue to volunteer for, my wonderul team assigned to me the task of modifying preexisting Python2 code and updating the syntax to reflect Python3's. I learned how to capture packets from a drone using Kali Linux, as well as how to parse through a JSON file that details packet information and use the NumPy and the Matplotlib librares to arrange and plot packet data.
