## No Improvement Without Standards

Motivational guru Tony Robbins has stated that if you want to change your life, you have to raise your standards. Raising your standards, however, means making a lot of investments; and making an investment usually requires a ton of time or money, or a combination of both. Learning coding standards doesn't really require much money, however, so it really just comes down to spending time. Recently, our class was introduced using ESLint with IntelliJ.

## Impressions of ESLint

Learning IntelliJ and ESLint was quite enjoyable for me. It was straightforward and easy to use, and I prefer using it over JSFiddle. Learning how to utilize these tools also helped me in beautified my code: I appreciate how it forces me to write neat and readable code. Additionally, I've always thought that the Github Desktop app was useless, preferring to use the command line to commit and push my repos. Upon learning how to actually use it, however, I found that pushing all of my commits to my Github repo via Github Desktop is the easiest it's ever been. I hate the command line now, as well as every individual who's ever promoted the use of the commandline and has looked down on Github Desktop. I hate myself more for listening to these people.

## Conclusions
As I discover the basic functionalities of the ESLint and IntelliJ tools, I found a sudden urge to write code that has both form and function. I've also found a sudden urge to raise my standards in life, like eating healthier and exercising more.
