## It Doesn't Benefit Anybody

I admit it: I feel personally attacked discussing this topic, as I've asked my  share of "stupid" questions before. I realize now, however, that the responses I receive from asking stupid questions don't really benefit anybody, especially not me. In my experience, the person answering the question would interpret my question differently, and the most their could do if they were willing to help is to try their best to answer, but that answer might not be what I was looking for in the first place. In the end, it's a waste of time, and I eventually would resort to Googling things.

## A smart way vs. a stupid way to ask a (StackOverflow) question

In browsing questions on StackOverflow, I found that the "smart" questions are genuinely sparked by the questioner's curiosity and are characterized by directness and definitiveness, so as not to confuse those who intend on answering. An example of such a question is found [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array)


In contrast, an example of a "stupid" question is one that isn't necessarily "stupid" in the sense that it begets such an obvious answer. As seen [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3905734/how-to-send-100-000-emails-weekly), a "stupid" question is one that stirs up ethical controversy.

## Takeaways
As discussed by Raymond and Moen, it is important to be clear and considerate when asking a question on a forum like StackOverflow.
