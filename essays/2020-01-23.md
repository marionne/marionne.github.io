## A refreshing change of pace

From the tediousness of writing ARM assembly language instructions in SystemVerilog (a hardware description language (HDL) syntactically and structurally similar to C), to the strict usage of identifiers and memory allocation specificities in C/C++, formally learning JavaScript for the first time was a refreshing change of pace. The only other experience I’ve had pertaining to JavaScript was when I participated in a drone security project that involved translating a program in Python that could parse through a large JSON file. As I attempt to code in this alien language, I often find myself having many doubts about my program, but trying to force the program to run anyway and hoping for the best. I personally feel as though syntax problems are inevitable and expected when learning any foreign programming language, but such a dilemma is easily solvable with a quick Google search, or by scrolling through the JavaScript Basics module from freeCodeCamp.

## Parallels with Other Languages

Overall, JavaScript is just as “good” as any other programming language and conceptually isn’t too different from any of the other programming languages I have learned thus far. But I don’t like to compare, as I believe that flexibility between programming languages is a skill in and of itself. JavaScript’s ES6 features are interesting in that novel methods for accomplishing the same tasks using concise syntax and simple semantics makes for readable and aesthetically-pleasing code.

## Achilles’ Heel

From a computer engineering standpoint, my exposure to athletic software engineering is one that I would say is truly humbling. For me, it is not the syntax errors or the semantic invalidity that bothers me as much as the implementation of logically-correct statements that return the correct output. Having done things the “engineering” way, I have become accustomed to finding simple solutions to problems with over-usage of the “trial-and error” method without a thorough understanding of why something works. I realize that this process of doing things is not at all beneficial for me in the long run, particularly when it comes to writing programs, since I might encounter a similar problem in the future, but rather than being able to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem and correct it immediately, I would be spending an unecessary amount of time failing to obtain the correct results. I still struggle greatly with implementing algorithms, and I feel as though attempting to implement them under a time constraint has magnified my shortcomings as a student in computer science and engineering, and thus I am forced to acknowledge my Achilles’ heel.

## A Necessary Evil

So far, the WODs have helped me understand why the programs I write do—or don’t— work. For these reasons, WODs, though daunting and stressful and not particularly enjoyable for me, are a necessary evil for advancement. I look forward to developing efficient problem-solving skills through more WODs.
