# Life Before Semantic UI

Before I was introduced to Semantic UI, I never expected there to be a standard when came to creating webpages. I used to think it was just plain old HTML and CSS. I had some experience with HTML before, but CSS was entirely new to me and was a little harder to learn with all of its various properties. One glaring issue for me, however is not knowing which pre-built features to use. A lot of discovery comes with trial and error. That being said, I found myself often guessing what is a legitimate property. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, so it's a hit or miss. As I built more webpages using only HTML and CSS, I found it very tedious process overall. I never thought designing a webpage would ever take up so much time.

# What is Semantic UI

Semantic UI is a front-end development framework that promises developers an easier and consistent way to create webpages. After having used Semantic UI, I found that it is a whole lot better than using HTML/CSS. It's faster and easier, and it saves a lot of time. I thought it was interesting especially how Semantic UI provides many different options for many different elements that can help you create user-friendly pages, such as multiple options for menus and even more menu states where you can control what the menu should look like, and how the menu should behave.

# Conclusion
The Semantic UI framework helps simplify the process of designing webpages, and I fully recommend it to anybody who aspires for a career in front-end development.
